# SongVote (in development)

**SongVote** is an app to allow users to:
- Adding songs, voting, and vetoing are done in rounds
- Add songs to a list (users have limited number of songs to add per round)
- Vote for the songs in the list
- Veto a song on the list (users have limited number of vetos per round)
- Use vote results to generate a list of "approved" songs for the round
- When a round ends, the song list resets. The song list from previous rounds is stored. Vetoes are resupplied to the users.
